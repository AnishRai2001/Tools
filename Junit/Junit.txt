What is Junit
####################

-> JUnit is a Java testing framework that helps you write and run unit tests — small, focused tests that verify the correctness of individual pieces of code (like a method or class) in isolation.

-> It’s lightweight, fast, and integrates easily with build tools like Maven and Gradle.

-> Versions: Latest major version is JUnit 5, which is more flexible and modular than JUnit 

-> Assertions: Offers methods check expected outcome with actual outcome


######################
What is JaCoCo
######################
(status of code how much it was executed)
-> JaCoCo tells you how much of your code was actually executed when you ran your tests.
-> It works as plugin with Junit
-> Often required for CI/CD quality gates (e.g., "Fail build if coverage < 80%").


######################
Why use Mockito?
######################
->   Mockito is one of the most popular mocking frameworks for Java
-> In real applications, a class often depends on other components — like databases, web services, or other classes.
-> When testing, you don’t want to call the real database or real API. Instead, you create mocks that simulate their behavior
